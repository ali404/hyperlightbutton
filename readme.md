Hyper Light Drifter's button animation

I wanted to get the gist of the animation (it's not an accurate replica though). You can find the mp4 screen recording in `frames/video.mp4` (30fps). The code is trash :p

Frames:
1. event dispatch
2. null frame
3. all text shown, yellow split shown in light opacity
4. blue/yellow/red splits shown
5. increase opacity
6. increase opacity, lower blue distance
7. lower red & blue distance
8. combine, show inner

(or something like that)
